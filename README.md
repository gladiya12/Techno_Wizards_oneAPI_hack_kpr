### Project Description
 The Current Leakage Monitoring System is an innovative sensor-based solution designed to continuously monitor the healthiness of electrical earthing systems. Utilizing a current leakage sensor (ACS712), Raspberry Pi Pico 2040, and alert mechanisms, this system aims to enhance safety in environments where electrical systems are installed, such as parking areas and stations.
In facilities with numerous electrical installations, ensuring the safety and functionality of earthing systems is crucial. Traditional manual inspections are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In the event of an earth leakage, immediate action is essential to prevent hazards to the public.
